# Plain-vigenere-cipher
this is a simple of script of a vigenere cipher. its to encrypt and decrypt text and it uses a custom_key (which is to control how each letter in the text is going to be shifted.)

FEATURES 
Encrypts and decrypts alphabetic text using a custom keyword, handles spaces and non-letter characters gracefully and clear function structure for easy understanding and extension

USAGE:
You can run python plain_cipher.py in your terminal 
but in the script you can modify values directly if you want it to encrypt other text.

As is it will encrypt the text 'peak piece' with the custom key  'baby'.
enjoy messing around with it, i have a version with a GUI coming soon with more features as well
