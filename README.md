# Plain-vigenere-cipher
This is a simple implementation of the Vigenère cipher in Python. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt alphabetic text using a custom_key, which determines how each letter in the text is shifted.

FEATURES 
Encrypts and decrypts alphabetic text using a custom keyword
Handles spaces and non-letter characters gracefully
Features a clear function structure for easy understanding and extension

USAGE:
You can run the script in your terminal using:  python plain_cipher.py
Inside the script, you can modify the values directly to encrypt any message you choose.
By default, it will encrypt the text 'peak piece' using the key 'baby'. Feel free to tweak the input and key—have fun experimenting!

What’s Next?
I'm currently working on a GUI version with even more features, so stay tuned!
